This project POSTs scores from a 2048 game to a Monogodb server  and GETs scores from the server which are displayed
on a webpage via the functions in the web.js file. The functions of the web.js file have been correctly implemented however 
I had trouble succesfully testing by modifying the 2048 game files as well as locating the objects within which the grid
and scores are stored. 

Location of score and grid:
  In the gamecenter object of the game_manager.js file 

Collaborators:
Tim Alander for setting up and using Mongoose.

Hours spent:
10-15 hours
